This year was a little less hectic on the MicroPython side as we already had a framework and all we needed to do was test and write the actual code to complete the missions we wanted the robot to do. Thus, this year we could have a little more relaxed offseason, but also teach junior members Python and introduce them to MicroPython. Overall, members found that MicroPython gave much deeper control of the robot and thus could be tuned to be much smoother and robust than LabView, especially with the help of the built-in accleration control. Although it is definitely harder to grasp than LabView for visual people, it was overall a good learning experience for everybody. There were still some problems we faced this year and if you would like to hear more about it or if you have any questions about a MicroPython project you're doing, please email us at jpothen8@gmail.com, with the subject like "FLL MicroPython". The docs may not be the most useful for every situation, so we'd be glad to help in any way possible :D
